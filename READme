## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a client-side JavaScript application that demonstrates core **DOM (Document Object Model)** and **BOM (Browser Object Model)** concepts. The application presents a real-estate FAQ page with dynamic behavior, form validation, user interaction handling, and templated content generation.

The focus of this project is **correct usage of DOM manipulation, event handling, validation, and browser APIs**, not visual complexity.


🧱 Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)
* Browser Developer Tools (Console)


 ✅ Implemented Requirements

1. HTML Structure

* Semantic HTML elements (`header`, `main`, `footer`, `form`)
* FAQ content structured using reusable `.faq-item` containers
* `<template>` element used for dynamic content generation

2. Form with HTML Attribute Validation

The subscription form includes built-in HTML validation:

* `required` attributes on inputs
* `type="email"` for automatic email format validation

```html
<input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>
```

3. DOM Event-Based Validation (in addition to HTML validation)

In addition to HTML validation, JavaScript event-based validation is implemented:

* A `blur` event listener on the email input
* Visual feedback (red border) when the user leaves the field empty
* Border resets once valid input is provided

This provides **real-time UI feedback** before form submission.


4. Event Listeners & Event Handlers

At least **two different event listeners** are registered:

| Event              | Target        | Purpose                              |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `DOMContentLoaded` | `document`    | Initialize DOM-dependent logic       |
| `submit`           | `form`        | Validate and process form submission |
| `blur`             | `email input` | Event-based input validation         |

Each event has an associated handler function.


5. DOM Manipulation

The project demonstrates multiple DOM manipulation techniques:

* `createElement()` to generate new content
* `appendChild()` and `insertBefore()` to insert elements
* `classList.add()` to modify CSS classes dynamically
* `style` property for inline styling updates
* Iteration over element collections using loops


6. Template & cloneNode Usage

Reusable FAQ items are generated using:

* `<template>` element in HTML
* `cloneNode(true)` in JavaScript
* Dynamic insertion relative to the template’s position in the DOM

This allows flexible placement without hard-coding container locations.


7. Browser Object Model (BOM) Usage

At least **two BOM methods/properties** are used:

* `window.alert()` – user feedback after form submission
* `console.log()` – debugging and inspection via DevTools


8. Styling & CSS Class Manipulation

In response to user interaction:

* The form receives a `submitted` class after successful submission
* CSS visually updates the form to indicate completion


9. Error Prevention & Stability

To ensure the program runs without errors:

* All DOM-dependent logic is wrapped in `DOMContentLoaded`
* Event listeners are attached at appropriate lifecycle stages
* Duplicate or unsafe operations were removed or corrected
* Features that could cause runtime errors were debugged and stabilized

Blockers encountered (such as variable scope issues) were resolved by:

* Moving logic into correct scopes
* Ensuring listeners are registered before use
* Avoiding duplicate DOM insertions


🧪 How to Run the Project

1. Open the HTML file in a modern web browser
2. Open Developer Tools (Inspect → Console)
3. Interact with the form and FAQ sections
4. Observe validation behavior, alerts, and dynamic content insertion


🧠 Key Learning Outcomes

* Understanding the difference between DOM and BOM
* Correctly managing JavaScript scope and timing
* Implementing both HTML and JavaScript-based validation
* Using templates for reusable UI components
* Debugging real-world JavaScript errors effectively
